###   Lab 1: Simulated SOC: EDR Home Lab | [View Github Repository](https://github.com/timothydarosa/Simulated-SOC-Attack-Defense-EDR-Home-Lab)
[ View Simulated SOC: EDR Home Lab Video](https://youtu.be/O-iN99pJXZM)

<h4>This lab is dedicated to simulating a real cyber attack and endpoint detection and response. Utilizing Eric Capuano's guide online, I will be using virtual machines to simulate the threat & victim machines. The attack machine will utilize 'Sliver' as a C2 framework to attack a Windows endpoint machine, which will be running 'LimaCharlie' as an EDR solution.</h4>

âœ” Deploying a C2 server with Sliver to simulate real-world threats  
âœ” Collecting and analyzing telemetry using Sysmon & LimaCharlie  
âœ” Creating and tuning detection & response rules for threat detection  
âœ” Investigating Indicators of Compromise from system and network logs  
âœ” Using YARA to scan for malware and detect malicious activity  
âœ” Blocking and responding to attacks in our simulated SOC environment

Lab 2: Cybersecurity Detection & Monitoring Lab | [View Github Repository](https://github.com/timothydarosa/Cybersecurity-Detection-Monitoring-Lab)

<h4>Building a Cybersecurity home lab utilizing VMware and pfSense for secure network simulations, apply Security Onion for threat detection, and prepare Kali Linux for attack simulations. You'll also gain experience in configuring Windows systems and using Splunk, as well as integrating various Linux machines for diverse cybersecurity scenarios. I will be following along with cyberwox and cybermentor's walkthroughs for this homelab. We also used domain controllers and Active Directory</h4>


âœ” Setting up VMware Workstation as Hypervisor   
âœ” Configuring pfSense Firewall for Enhanced Network Segmentation and Security   
âœ” Setting up Security Onion as a Comprehensive IDS, Security Monitoring, and Log Management Solution   
âœ” Preparing Kali Linux for Attack Simulations   
âœ” Setting up a Windows Server to Function as a Domain Controller/Active Directory   
âœ” Configuring a Windows-Based Desktop   
âœ” Configuring Splunk on Ubuntu Server   
âœ” Installing Splunk's Universal Forwarder
