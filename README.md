<h4>This lab is dedicated to simulating a real cyber attack and endpoint detection and response. Utilizing Eric Capuano's guide online, I will be using virtual machines to simulate the threat & victim machines. The attack machine will utilize 'Sliver' as a C2 framework to attack a Windows endpoint machine, which will be running 'LimaCharlie' as an EDR solution.</h4>

âœ” Deploying a C2 server with Sliver to simulate real-world threats  
âœ” Collecting and analyzing telemetry using Sysmon & LimaCharlie  
âœ” Creating and tuning detection & response rules for threat detection  
âœ” Investigating Indicators of Compromise from system and network logs  
âœ” Using YARA to scan for malware and detect malicious activity  
âœ” Blocking and responding to attacks in our simulated SOC environment
